# Feathers.js & Vue.js Chat Example

## Installation
Please ensure you're running the latest version of node.js.

Clone this repo and run `npm install` in both the `client` and `server` directories.

## Usage
Open two terminals sessions, one will run the server, the other will run the client dev-server.

Type `npm start` to run the server and `npm run dev` to run the client dev-server. Once running, visit `http://localhost:8080` to view the app.

## Explanation
Below is a video I recorded to explain how Vuex works in conjunction with Feathers.js, providing us with realtime functionality. The code shown in the video is just slighly different as I took Evan You's suggestions (in the video comments) to refactor the code, which is what you see in this repo.
